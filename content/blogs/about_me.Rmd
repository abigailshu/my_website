My name is Abigail Shu. I was born and raised in Kaohsiung - a city in the Southern part of Taiwan. I attended an international school in Kaohsiung from year 1 - 12, and used to play violin through both private lessons and orchestras.

I currently hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from New York University Abu Dhabi. Given that most of my high school classmates attended their undergraduate programs in either US, Canada, or Europe - going to an American institution in Abu Dhabi was certainly a very different decision. However, this was one of the best decisions I've ever made, as it gave me a unique experience in a university with students from over 100 different nationalities.

I'm currently under the Master's in Financial Analysis (MFA) program at London Business School (LBS) - and will be joining an elite boutique investment bank in Hong Kong after I complete the MFA program at LBS.
